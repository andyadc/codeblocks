## Overview

Create a comprehensive guide and code examples for using Apache HttpClient 4.x in production environments. This will
demonstrate best practices and cover various common use cases.

## Requirements

### Basic Configuration Examples

- Connection pooling setup with optimal settings
- Request/response timeout configurations
- Proxy settings
- SSL/TLS configuration with custom trust store
- Custom retry mechanisms
- Connection keep-alive settings

### Authentication Examples

- Basic authentication
- Bearer token authentication
- Custom authentication schemes
- Cookie handling

### Request/Response Handling

- GET, POST, PUT, DELETE methods
- Form data submission
- Multipart file uploads
- JSON request/response handling
- XML request/response handling
- Streaming large files
- Handling compressed content (gzip)
- Custom header management

### Advanced Features

- Request interceptors
- Response handlers
- Connection management
- Thread-safe usage patterns
- Resource cleanup
- Memory management

### Error Handling

- Proper exception handling
- Connection timeouts
- Socket timeouts
- Connection pool exhaustion
- SSL/TLS errors

### Monitoring and Metrics

- Connection pool metrics
- Request/response timing
- Success/failure rates
- Resource usage monitoring

### Performance Optimization

- Connection pooling best practices
- Memory optimization techniques
- Thread pool configuration
- Keep-alive strategy

## Expected Deliverables

1. Complete code examples with comments
2. Configuration templates for different scenarios
3. Best practices documentation
4. Common pitfalls and solutions
5. Performance tuning guidelines

## Additional Considerations

- All examples should follow Java coding best practices
- Include unit tests for the examples
- Document memory management considerations
- Include logging configurations
- Add performance benchmarks where applicable
